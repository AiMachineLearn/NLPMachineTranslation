# NLP Machine Translation
In this notebook, I've built a recurrent neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. It accepts English text as input and returns the French translation.

## Example
Input:  new jersey is sometimes quiet during autumn , and it is snowy in april .
Output:  new jersey est parfois calme pendant l' automne , et il est neigeux en avril .

## Install
- Python 3
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 1.x
- Keras 2.x
